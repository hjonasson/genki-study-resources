          Vocab Memorization Tips
        </h2>
        <p>
          The following tips are for use with the vocab exercises on this
          website and should help you with memorizing the vocab for each lesson.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            After completing a vocab exercise, <b>take a break</b>, as this will
            help with reinforcing your memory. I recommend taking incrementally
            longer break periods between exercises. Starting at 5min breaks and
            increasing by 5min or 10min each time until you hit your personal
            limit, such as 60min, or until you feel you've memorized the vocab.
            After this you can take a break for the day and revisit the exercise
            tomorrow to see how well you remember the vocab.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you're having trouble memorizing readings,
            <b
              >keep the furigana visible for at least the first 3 exercise
              sessions</b
            >, then take it away and only display it when you cannot remember
            the reading AT ALL.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Limit yourself to a set amount of words per day</b>. Personally,
            I feel around 15-30 words to be the sweet spot, but everyone is
            different, so take it a little at a time and don't overwhelm
            yourself or rush.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Find material to read that utilizes the vocab you're studying</b>
            to help further aid with memorization. Fortunately, Genki offers
            material to read using the lesson's vocab in the dialogue and
            reading and writing sections, so you wont have to do much searching.
            You can also find example sentences by using
            <a href="https://sentencesearch.neocities.org/" target="_blank"
              >this tool</a
            >
            or
            <a
              href="https://jisho.org/search/%E5%85%83%E6%B0%97%20%23sentences"
              target="_blank"
              >jisho</a
            >, or even websites such as
            <a
              href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22%E3%81%93%E3%81%AE%E7%8C%AB%E8%B6%85%E5%8F%AF%E6%84%9B%E3%81%84%22&src=typed_query&f=live"
              target="_blank"
              >twitter</a
            >
            to see native examples. Adding "<a
              href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22%E3%81%93%E3%81%AE%E3%83%91%E3%83%B3%E7%BE%8E%E5%91%B3%E3%81%97%E3%81%99%E3%81%8E%E3%82%8B%22%20.pic&src=typed_query&f=live"
              target="_blank"
              >.pic</a
            >" to a search on twitter also helps a ton with visualization.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I hope that these tips will aid you with your vocab studies!
          Additionally, if you have trouble with this method, I would highly
          recommend using
          <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">Anki</a> instead
          with the <a href="../anki-decks/" target="_blank">Genki decks</a>.
