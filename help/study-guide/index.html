        <p>
          Self-studying with Genki is fairly straightforward, but this guide
          will aim to give you a general idea of what path to take while
          studying with the Genki textbooks. Firstly, if you have not yet
          memorized the Hiragana and Katakana, please read the section below
          about the <a href="#writing-system">Japanese Writing System</a>,
          otherwise jump to the
          <a href="#study-routine">Study Routine</a> section.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3 class="section-title" id="writing-system">
          Japanese Writing System
        </h3>
        <p>
          It is imperative that you memorize the Hiragana and Katakana as you'll
          be using them daily in your studies. You can review the Japanese
          Writing System on page 20 of Genki I (p.24 for the 2nd Edition), then
          practice memorizing a column or two each day with the Hiragana and
          Katakana exercises
          <a href="../../lessons-3rd/#lesson-0-writing">here</a>. Tofugu's
          guides for
          <a
            href="https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/"
            target="_blank"
            >Hiragana</a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-katakana/"
            target="_blank"
            >Katakana</a
          >
          are also quite helpful if you're having difficulty memorizing the
          kana, thanks to their mnemonics. Memorizing the kana should take
          anywhere from 1-2 weeks or longer depending on the person, so just
          take your time and don't rush it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you have the Hiragana and Katakana memorized, you can practice by
          learning some common greetings in the あいさつ section on page 30 of
          Genki I (p.34 for the 2nd Edition). You can also practice these
          greetings <a href="../../lessons-3rd/#lesson-0-greetings">here</a>.
          Once you feel you're ready, we can move onto Lesson 1 of Genki. Please
          see the section below for info on how to tackle each lesson.
        </p>

      <div class="content-block">
        <h3 class="section-title" id="study-routine">Study Routine</h3>
        <p>Below is a list of things to do each lesson.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Memorize the Vocabulary</strong> for the current lesson. You
            can do this with either the
            <a href="../anki-decks/">Anki decks</a> or the vocabulary exercises
            under each lesson on this website (ex.
            <a href="../../lessons-3rd/#lesson-1">Lesson 1</a>). If using the
            latter method, please see
            <a href="../vocab-memorization/">this page</a> for tips on
            memorizing vocabulary.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Read the Dialogue and Grammar Points</strong> for the
            current lesson. Once you finish the workbook exercises for this
            lesson (Step 4), you can go back and read the dialogue once more to
            see how well you understand it now compared to when you first read
            it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Do the Practice Exercises</strong> and, if something is
            unclear, go back and re-read the grammar point for the current
            exercise. Practice exercises on this website can be done in either
            multiple choice or written format*. (*written is only available for
            the 3rd edition resources.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Do the Workbook Exercises</strong> for the grammar you just
            practiced. Workbook exercises are in written format only to help you
            get accustomed to writing in Japanese. Please see
            <a href="../writing/">this page</a> if you don't know how to type in
            Japanese.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Do the Reading and Writing Section</strong>. This section is
            accessible in the back of the textbooks, after the grammar section,
            and is used to help teach you about kanji as well as improve your
            reading comprehension with bite-sized reading exercises.
            Additionally, if you'd like to expand your vocab, you can memorize
            all the new words introduced in the kanji section's kanji-compounds.
            This can also aid with memorizing kanji readings and meanings.<br /><small
              ><strong>Note:</strong> You can do this section first before steps
              2-4 for Lessons 1 and 2, because they provide you with extra
              practice for the Hiragana and Katakana, which some people may
              still be struggling with.</small
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Do the Reading and Writing Workbook Exercises</strong>.
            These will help to further improve your reading ability as well as
            listening comprehension.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Repeat the Steps Above for each Lesson</strong> until you
            finish Genki I &amp; II.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          That's everything! On average it can take about 1-2 weeks to complete
          a lesson, but this varies from person to person. So, take your time
          and ensure that you properly understand the contents of each lesson!
          Even if it's just a little each day, as long as you try to study daily
          you'll slowly but surely come to better understand the language. Keep
          at it and best of luck on your studies!
